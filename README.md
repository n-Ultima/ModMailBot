## <center> The ModmailBot meant to simplify communication between Staff and community members! </center>

## What is it?
### Modmail bot is a general-purpose bot that's designed to allow Staff of Discord servers to easily contact and communicate with their members.
## How do I use it?
### Quite simple! First, change `config.Example.json` to `config.json`, then fill in the values as needed. If one isn't filled or the incorrect data type is provided for a field, it will throw an error upon startup. Then to start, simply use the `dotnet run` command.
## How do I contribute?
### Just open a pull-request or issue, then from there we can move forward. Feel free to stop by our <a href=http://www.ultima.one/discord> Discord! </a>
